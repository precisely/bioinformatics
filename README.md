# Bioinformatics

This repository contains all software that requires knowledge of
bioinformatics software, databases, and methods. The goal is to
sequester the more detailed bioinformatic data handling in this repo,
so that other code repos can simply use this repo as a black box.


## `23andme-imputation`

This directory contains the 2018-era imputation pipeline. Not currently used.


## `terraform`

This directory contains [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) configuration for running the bioinformatics infrastructure.
